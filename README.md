Problem

An investor is looking to invest in a company that has a good financial prognosis
The inventor is looking to see which markets would be beneficial for a short term investment.

Solution

To solve the question, we are going to take two initial steps.
The first being, is to create a dashboard for a Profit and Loss Statement that calculates the Gross Profit, Operating Profit/EBIT for a company selected from a drop-down list. The drop-down list pulls historical fundamentals data to create the P&L Statement.
Next, is to create a financial model for r choice that forecasts out the Gross Profit, Operating Profit or EBIT for two more years using three scenarios (Best case, Weak case and Base case). The assumptions for revenue growth, gross margin and operating margin changes for each scenario.
